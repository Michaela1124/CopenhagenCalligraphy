			<p class="title">Customer event at Restaurant Geranium</p>
			<p class="paragraph">For a large-scale luxury event with complex seating arrangements, place-cards on the table are a must, and nothing sends a message of appreciation to your guests like an exquisitely hand-written one. Not only do place cards [Danish: “bordkort”] help invitees find their seat, it also helps guests around the table bond with each other more effortlessly, with a gentle reminder of their neighbour's name. For an international mix of guests, this can be a blessing.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Last summer, Copenhagen Calligraphy provided personalized table cards for a client appreciation dinner held by a Swiss wealth fund. The setting: Restaurant Geranium, Copenhagen's only Michelin 3-star restaurant.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Orchestrating a dinner to impress is no small accomplishment, and from the start we were there to ensure our client's dinner went seamlessly. Most of the calligraphy was finished in our atelier before the event. However, with a VIP guest list that can evolve by the minute, we made sure to be on standby to provide any changes to the place cards. </p>
			<p class="paragraph">For the Geranium event, we were on site for the beginning of the event, to ensure that any plus-ones who had not been registered yet would also receive their place card.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">The result? Each guest was greeted by their own personalized, hand-written bordkort, giving them a sense of exclusivity that only heightened the evening's memorability. One guest even asked if we could write some more calligraphy for them to take home, which we gladly provided for them!</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Our client's privacy is of the utmost importance to us, and therefore we could not provide any photos of the actual place cards used at the event, as they contain guest names. However, if you browse the “work” section of our website, you will find many examples of how we can enhance the dining experience of your customer dinners.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Contact us today for your upcoming event, and we will be happy to delight both you and your guests.</p>
